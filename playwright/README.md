# Components (experimental) | Playwright

- https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components

> This file defines an html file that will be used to render components during testing.
> It must contain element with `id="root"`, that's where components are mounted.
> It must also link the script called `playwright/index.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`.
> 
> You can include stylesheets, apply theme and inject code into the page where component is mounted using this script.
> It can be either a `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx` or `.tsx` file.
